# Requirements
## Introduction
 - The electronics parameters calculator is a useful utility for electronics hobbyists and professionals alike. By enetering the required parameters, the user will be able to directly get access to a lot of information regarding selection of passive components for projects, complex values required for inductors and capacitors, life of a battery, etc.
 - By working on this project I was able to revise all important concepts of C Programming while also designing a tool that would prove helpful to a lot of electronics enthusiasts.

## Research
### Importance of Electronics Utilities
- Designing electronic circuits is a fun process but there is a lot of math involved in it as well. The usual microntrollers come with prebuilt PCBs that are basically plug and play, but for anyone looking to design their own hardware from scratch, the numerous calculations required can become a hassle.
- Any system requires a large number of passive components and even specialized ICs need to be provided with the proper passive attachments in order to function properly.
- New electronics hobbyists can find the complex calculations involving frequencies, reactances and minute values overwhelming.
- By utilizing such resources, people can simply input their requirements and get the desired values of the parameters that they are trying to find.
